        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education/Human Developmentüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">(pronouns: she/her) The first female teacher to live-stream her class from the moon. Was called upon by the people of the United States to serve as first female POTUS by humbly refused. Three-time gold medalist. Spends her part-time coaching young athletes with fiery passion and teaching foreign students/parents English. Comes from twitter, all cool teachers come from twitter. Also, likes long walks on the beach. <br><br>

        Teaches eleventh grade English and often incorporates rap freestyles in her sessions for creative purposes but will also use these to resolve conflicts between students in the classroom, call this "rap battles". Supports afterschool programs and is open to student feedback unless it is bad. Is the teacher that is all caught up with modern slang, so no you will not need to explain anything, I will understand the referrence. Hates to be left on cliffhangers with shows so has random days in which the whole class watches them so I can catch up as long as no one has any spoilers. Everyone who is Team Edward gets to choose their seats, while the others have assigned seats. Will randomly let my dog Max choose two assignments to chew up, those two assignments will receive 100 percent as a grade. At the end of the year, I participate in the board of educators who are granted the decision of picking three lucky and deserving students to attend the famously known school of magic, Hogwarts. Does, however, share corny tendencies like those shown in movies where the teacher begins a poetry lesson with students in which later everyone ends up emotional and the tears begin to fall. Near the end, has all of her passing students participate in the reenactment of the iconic scene in Twilight where the Cullins and Bella play vampire baseball. <br><br>

        Daughter to a family of five, and I am the one that keeps them all sane. Also this means I have experience as a caretaker, maid, therapist, tutor, WWE wrestler, and personal assistant. Attended both private schools and public schools/universities growing up. Learned how to skateboard at three years old, only after I had officially learned how to rock climb. Was sent away to a boarding school where I became the person who took the picture of the first person to climb Mount Everest. Later I escaped to Fiji where I learned how to build a submarine from scratch and ate fruit by the sea. I lived a couple of years in Mazatlan, built homes in Croatia, and saved a child from being eaten by a shark near the islands of Sina Una. Single-handedly was responsible for changing the course of the lava flow from one of the deadliest volcanoes in Italy, tempting them to almost name their country ‚ÄúIrtaly‚Äù, my first name, instead of plain old ‚ÄúItaly‚Äù. However, the most memorable experience apart from being a teacher was performing heart surgery on a stranger in an elevator when it was stuck and receiving a Doctrine right after, without the pain and sorrow of debt from what would have been four years of med school.
